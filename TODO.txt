TO DO:
    checkmate notation --> how to determine if moves are checkmate and properly append it to the notation in legal moves list --> Current implementation leads to inf recursion
        Annoying but not highest priority. Game still ends properly
    print or save board states and moves
    castling
    ambiguous moves
