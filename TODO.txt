TO DO:
    checkmate notation --> how to determine if moves are checkmate and properly append it to the notation in legal moves list --> Current implementation leads to inf recursion
        Annoying but not highest priority. Game still ends properly
    print or save board states and moves
    castling
    ambiguous moves


    add chessNotation attribute to stored legal moves (reduces function calls, easier for debugging later)


        I need to adjust/fix the findAmbigousMoves method. Once a move has been made ambigiuous, LEAVE IT ALONE!
        
        TUESDAY
        Ambigious moves (update chess notation stuff and make moves actually properly execute)
        castling
        saving board states
        WEDNESDAY
        return to the checkmate issue
