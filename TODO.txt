TO DO:
    
    

    castling (TESTING OF WRITTEN FUNCTIONS)
    ambiguous moves --> accurate ambiguity markers (only use as many as are needed)
    checkmate notation --> how to determine if moves are checkmate and properly append it to the notation in legal moves list --> Current implementation leads to inf recursion (Annoying but not highest priority. Game still ends properly)

    saving board states (need to create a board --> FEN) NOT NEEDED UNTIL AFTER FULLY WORKING GAME
