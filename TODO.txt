Need to figure out why all moves are being made from the perspective of white 
    ANSWER: move code establishes piece type by chess notation ,which is from the perspective of white (capital letters).
            created an enumeration that will allow for conversion to black when making moves

need to obviously fix move generation --> Longer term problem that should be tackled laer once other aspects are guaranteed accurate/working

check and checkmate functions and prune legalMoves out of these

Need to modularize most functions to take a board parameter expicitly --> important for later game analysis & handling of move legality



Need to review and create helper methods and restructure for proper encapsulation

Need to get a clear understanding of checklist
