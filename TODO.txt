    saving board states (need to create a board --> FEN) NOT NEEDED UNTIL AFTER FULLY WORKING GAME

    castling
        -fix/address scenario where castling puts opponent in check
    Fix improper tagging of checkmate
    ambiguous
        -make consistent notation (rank or file or both)
 
    Properly encapsulate check/mate tagging
        
        Restructure makeMove as it bears a lot of responsibility?
