1. Basics of Bitboards:
* What is a Bitboard?
    * A bitboard is a 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64_t) where each bit represents a square on a chessboard.
    * Each of the 64 bits corresponds to one square on the 8x8 board, 
        with the least significant bit (LSB) representing the square a1
        the most significant bit (MSB) representing the square h8.
        

* Bitwise Operations:
    * AND (&): Check if a bit is set (e.g., whitePawns & (1ULL << square) checks if a pawn is on a specific square).
    * OR (|): Set a specific bit (e.g., whitePawns |= (1ULL << square) places a white pawn on a square).
    * XOR (^): Flip a specific bit.
    * Shift Left (<<) / Shift Right (>>): Move bits left or right, e.g., to update positions of pieces.
    * NOT (~): Flip all bits (used for clearing squares).

2. Understanding Chessboard Representation:
    * BOARD REPRESENTATION BY BIT
        8 | 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63
        7 | 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55  <-- Black pawns (bits 48-55)
        6 | 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
        5 | 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
        4 | 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
        3 | 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
        2 |  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  <-- White pawns (bits 8-15)
        1 |  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
        0 |  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
* Coordinate System:
    * The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, with rows numbered 1-8 and columns labeled a-h.
    * You'll need to convert between board coordinates (e.g., a1, h8) and bit positions (0-63).
        * Example: Square a1 maps to position 0 (LSB), and h8 maps to position 63 (MSB).
* Bitboard for Piece Representation:
    * Each piece type (Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King) will have a dedicated bitboard.
    * Use bitwise operations to track the positions of specific pieces on the board.

3. Chess Rules & Mechanics:
* Piece Movement:
    * Understand how each piece moves and how to generate legal moves using bitboards.
        * Example: Rook moves in straight lines (vertical and horizontal), while Bishops move diagonally.
    * For each piece, you'll need bitboard manipulations to calculate its legal moves based on the current position.
* Special Rules:
    * Castling: The king and rook move simultaneously under certain conditions.
    * En Passant: Special pawn capture rule.
    * Pawn Promotion: A pawn that reaches the 8th rank is promoted to another piece (usually a Queen).
4. Key Class Methods and Logic:
* Initialization: Set up the bitboards for each piece in their starting positions.
    * White pawns at a2 through h2, black pawns at a7 through h7, etc.
    * Other pieces follow their initial placement, e.g., knights on b1, g1 for white, and b8, g8 for black.
* Movement Logic:
    * Youâ€™ll need to write functions to move pieces. For example:
        * movePiece(from, to): Move a piece from one square to another.
        * Update the relevant bitboards (whitePieces, blackPieces, occupiedSquares) after a move.
* Legal Move Generation:
    * Generate legal moves for a piece considering the rules of chess. Use bitboards for efficient calculations, e.g., sliding pieces like rooks and bishops.
* Occupied Squares:
    * Maintain an occupiedSquares bitboard that includes all pieces, white and black. It is used to check if a square is already occupied before placing a piece.
5. Chess Game Flow:
* Turn Order:
    * Alternate turns between white and black.
* Game Status:
    * Detect check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions using bitboards.
    * Check for special situations like castling or pawn promotion.
6. Performance Considerations:
* Efficiency with Bitboards:
    * Bitboard operations are extremely fast (constant time complexity), making them ideal for chess engines.
    * Optimize your functions using bitwise operations to reduce the complexity of move generation.
7. Visual Representation:
* Display the Board:
    * Write a function (displayBoard()) to output the board state in a human-readable format (8x8 grid). Each piece can be represented by a character (e.g., W for white, B for black).
8. Helper Functions:
* Bit to Board Coordinate Conversion:
    * Functions to convert between a bitboard position (0-63) and the corresponding chessboard square (a1-h8).
* Piece Position Queries:
    * Functions like isWhitePiece(square) or isBlackRook(square) to check the presence of specific pieces.
9. Testing and Debugging:
* Unit Testing:
    * Test bitboard manipulation logic using small, controlled scenarios (e.g., moving a piece, detecting checks).
* Edge Cases:
    * Handle edge cases such as trying to move a piece off the board, promoting a pawn, or castling.
10. Future Enhancements:
* AI or Move Evaluation:
    * Implement a basic AI using minimax or alpha-beta pruning for move evaluation.
* User Interface:
    * If you want to take this further, you could add a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like SFML or SDL to represent the board visually.
