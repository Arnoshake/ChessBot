Pawn Movements are weirder than the other pieces because:
- not sliding (rook, bishop, queen)
- not like a knight (jumps) or a king ( 1 sq)
- most dynamic move rules based off scenario
    *single vs double push
    *en Passant
        White pawns on 5th rank // Black pawns on 4th rank
        PREVIOUS move must be double pawn push to adjacent rank square
